  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>I'm a computer guy who does internet stuff. I work at <a href="http://tribesports.com">Tribesports</a> and make things with Ruby, JavaScript, CSS4 and HTML7. It all sounds a bit intangible when you compare it to a nurse or the guy who makes your sandwiches at Pret or something.</p>
